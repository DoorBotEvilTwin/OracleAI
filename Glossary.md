## Appendix H: Glossary of OracleAI Terms (v0.4 Update)

*   **Content:** An updated and expanded glossary defining key terms, acronyms, and concepts specific to the OracleAI v0.4.1 project (e.g., Akashic Record, Chronicle, Citadel, Sanctum, CCEL, Sage, Seer, Shaman, DataSide, Hyperspace Journey, MemCon, Context Scaler, RAG, RRF, DCWM, LlamaIndex, Library, SearxNG, Tor, Neural Graffiti, BMMM, AlphaEvolve, etc.).
*   **Purpose:** Ensures consistent terminology and understanding.

This glossary defines key terms, acronyms, and concepts specific to the OracleAI project (up to the v0.4 vision) to ensure consistent understanding throughout the documentation, development process, and user interaction. Terms are tagged with `(USER)` if primarily coined or driven by the user, `(LLM)` if primarily proposed or elaborated by the AI assistant during design, `(VC)` if originating from or directly inspired by the Vector Companion project, and `(TAS)` if a concept was significantly informed by the Text Analysis Suite (v1.5, created by Fentible). Many terms have collaborative origins.

*   **Active Context Cache (DCWM) (LLM, BigDataset Inspired):** A short-term, in-memory (or `profile.db`) cache used by the Dynamic Context Window Management (DCWM) system. It stores RAG context chunks that have been evaluated as highly utilitarian in recent interactions, allowing them to be prioritized for inclusion in subsequent LLM prompts to enhance conversational coherence on actively discussed topics.
*   **Agent (USER, LLM, VC):** An AI persona within OracleAI (Sage, Seer, Shaman) with a distinct role, system prompt defining its persona and operational modes, LLM configuration, and TTS voice, designed to provide specialized assistance.
*   **Agent Operational Modes (USER, LLM):** User-selectable configurations (via `.env` or GUI) that tailor an agent's system prompt and potentially LLM parameters to focus on specific types of tasks or interaction styles (e.g., Seer's "Lucid Mode" vs. "Cryptic Mode"; Shaman's "Analytical Mode" vs. "Sorcerer Focus Mode"; Sage's "Strategic Planning Mode").
*   **Akashic Record (USER, LLM, inspired by Rudolf Steiner):** The overarching name for OracleAI's entire persistent memory system. It encompasses all stored data, including raw interaction logs (Chronicle), synthesized knowledge (The Citadel), semantic vector embeddings (The Sanctum), user profiles, calendar information, tasks, and the user's "Library." Thematic reference to the esoteric concept of a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent.
*   **AlphaEvolve (LLM, BigDataset Inspired):** An advanced concept involving evolutionary algorithms combined with LLMs to iteratively improve code or programmatic solutions based on an automated evaluation function. Inspires Shaman's experimental "Evolutionary Optimizer Mode" and "Meta-Prompt Evolution" features in OracleAI v0.4.1+.

*   **Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) (LLM, BigDataset Inspired):** A technique where relevant documents or an entire knowledge base are preloaded into an LLM's context window, and the Key-Value (KV) cache for this preloaded context is precomputed and reused to potentially reduce inference time for queries over that knowledge. While full CAG is not planned for OracleAI v0.4.1 due to its large, dynamic memory, "Selective KV Caching" for frequently used RAG chunks is a v0.5+ research direction.
*   **Chronicle (USER, LLM):** The immutable, append-only raw log component of the Akashic Record, storing timestamped interaction data, emotion/NLU outputs, system events, and rich metadata as daily JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) files. Serves as the ground truth for all memory synthesis.
*   **Chronicle Cache (USER, LLM):** A temporary storage directory (`[AKASHIC_RECORD_PATH]/ChronicleCache/`) where new interaction log entries are first written as individual JSON files.

*   **Chrono-Contextual Echo Layer (CCEL) (USER, LLM):** A conceptual v0.4.1+ layer for querying and analyzing the episodic context (the "when, why, how, and under what conditions") surrounding the creation, modification, or interaction with specific pieces of information within the Akashic Record or agent states (like Neural Graffiti). Aims to provide deeper understanding of memory evolution and relevance.
*   **Citadel, The (Synthesis Store) (USER, LLM):** The primary structured knowledge base within the Akashic Record, stored as an SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite database (`synthesis.db`).

Employs hybrid search, query transformation, and Dynamic Context Window Management (DCWM) for v0.4.1.
*   **Context Size Estimator (CSE) (TAS, LLM):** A utility function (`text_utils.estimate_token_count()`) that estimates the token count of a given text prompt based on character length and a configurable heuristic (`CHARS_PER_TOKEN_ESTIMATE` in `.env`). Used for logging and developer insight.
